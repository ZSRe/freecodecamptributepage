            <em>Satoshi Nakamoto</em> is the name used by the presumed pseudonymous person or persons who developed Bitcoin, authored the Bitcoin white paper, and created and deployed bitcoin's original reference implementation. As part of the implementation, Nakamoto also devised the first blockchain database. In the process, Nakamoto was the first to solve the double-spending problem for digital currency using a peer-to-peer network. Nakamoto was active in the development of bitcoin up until December 2010. Many people have claimed, or have been claimed, to be Nakamoto.

          <strong>Nick Szabo</strong> is a decentralized currency enthusiast, and had published a paper on "bit gold", one of the precursors of bitcoin. He is known to have been interested in using pseudonyms in the 1990s.

          In a high-profile 6 March 2014 article in the magazine Newsweek, journalist Leah McGrath Goodman identified <strong>Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto</strong>, a Japanese American man living in California, whose birth name is Satoshi Nakamoto, as the Nakamoto in question. Besides his name, Goodman pointed to a number of facts that circumstantially suggested he was the bitcoin inventor.

          On 8 December 2015, Wired wrote that <strong>Craig Steven Wright</strong>, an Australian academic, "either invented bitcoin or is a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did".
